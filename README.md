## Description
This is the eleventh challenge of the UC Berkeley Web Development bootcamp in which we were challenged to build the back end for an e-commerce site. We were provided with a working Express.js API and asked to configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Usage
To use this application, which is back end only, you need to clone the repository, install all of the dependencies, and have a api testing program such as Postman or Insomnia. You'll need to have a MySQL account, and you'll need to make your own .env file with your creditials saved as the variables used in the config folder. You'll also need to seed your MySQL database using the index.js file in the seeds folder. Once all this is done you can build out your test api calls in the testing program of your choice.
